Hi !

Unfortunately, thanks to an unexpected behaviour in the Unity Editor the executable has a fixed resolution of full hd, 1980x1080, therefore computer screens with lower resolutions can't fit the whole game screen, given time I could surely solve this issue. I'm sorry for any inconvenience arising from this problem, alternatively, it's possible to run the game as intended inside the Unity Editor.

Thank you for your support.
